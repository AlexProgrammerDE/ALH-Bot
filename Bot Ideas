These are all just ideas I have for the bot's future, none of these are confirmed to be added.

-ALH Bot Ideas-

- !list (lists all the discords in a certain channel [Ex: !list 9b9t] )
- !ping (pings a server, says it's tps, amount of players, etc [like Crafty bot] )
- !u-info @user(sends a users account info [server nickname, name, id, account creation, server joindate, etc] )
- !s-info (sends info about the server [bot/member count, # of boosts, server creation date, # of roles, etc] )
- Global ALH chat (Setup a channel in your discord, and the bot will send messages from other servers [censors discord links and excessive spam, and pinging roles though] )
